# Rain-Prediction-with-ANN
The Rain Prediction project aims to harness the power of machine learning to forecast whether it will rain based on a diverse set of meteorological attributes. The implementation employs an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) due to its capability to capture intricate relationships within the data, providing accurate and reliable predictions.
