Rain Prediction with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

  Overview

This project focuses on predicting rain using machine learning techniques, specifically employing Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The goal is to develop a reliable weather prediction model based on historical data, enabling users to assess the likelihood of rain on a given day.

  Project Structure

1.  Model Training Notebook: 
   - model_training.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training the ANN-based rain prediction model.

2.  Trained Model: 
   - `models `: Directory containing the trained machine learning model.
     - model.pkl: Pickle file containing the trained ANN model for rain prediction.

3.  HTML Templates: 
   - `Template `: Directory containing HTML templates for the web application.
     - index.html: Home page of the web application.
     - predictor.html: Form for user input and rain prediction display.
     - rain.html: Template for displaying predictions for rainy weather.
     - sunny.html: Template for displaying predictions for non-rainy weather.

4.  Static Files: 
   - `static `: Directory containing static files such as images, stylesheets, etc.

5.  Python Script: 
   - app.py: Python script for running the web application.

6.  Data Preparation: 
   - prep.pkl: Contains the data pre processor.
   
7.  Dataset: 
   - weatherAUS.csv: CSV file containing historical weather data used for training and testing.

8.  Requirements: 
   - requirements.txt: File listing all the Python libraries and dependencies required to run the project.

  How to Run

1. Create virtual environment 
2. Install dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Run the web application using python app.py.
